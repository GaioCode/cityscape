## Introduction
Cityscape is a procedurally-generated city created using the OpenGL API. The aim of this project is to construct
an explorable, random cityscape, where buildings have different shapes and sizes. This project uses *Wolf*, a partial
engine created by Gordon Wood.

## Controls
- Use the WASD keys and mouse for first-person movement (mouse to be implemented).
- Use the Shift key to sprint.
